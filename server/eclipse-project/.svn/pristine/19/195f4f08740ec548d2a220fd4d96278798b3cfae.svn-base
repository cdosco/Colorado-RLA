# If a value for a credential (user name, password or grid response) is
# provided, it is used. If the credential is left blank, or is commented out,
# the user is prompted for it.
# When passwords and grid entries are required, for security purposes
# they must be entered from the terminal, not from a pipeline or via other
# stdin redirection, and will not be echoed.

# The string DoNotPrompt can be used here to suppress prompting for the grid
# entries, which is suitable for the DatabaseAuthentiation authentication_class.
# Comment all these lines out in order to prompt for all the values, for
# EntrustAuthentication.
