-- For each contest, and for each cast vote record in the random sequence
-- (with duplicates) for which the Audit Board has submitted information, and which 
-- covers the contest in question,
-- original cvr info, audit board interp info.
-- note that the random sequence index (includes dupes) is contest_audit_info.index
-- cvr_contest_info.index is the index of the *contest* on the ballot
-- Note that in case of an overvote, `cci_a.choices` shows all the choices the Audit Board thought the voter intended, while cci.choices will *not* show all those choices. 

-- TODO: ensure that "ballot not found" (cast_vote_record.record_type = 'PHANTOM_BALLOT') is properly handled
